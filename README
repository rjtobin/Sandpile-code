Bits of code useful for sandpile-type problems.  Here is a description of
the current code.  Those files that contain a main() include compilation
instructions in a comment at the start of the file.

sandpile.*: Functions to compute the sandpile process on Z^2 and regular 
trees.

png_draw.*: A small but useful little library to handle writing png files.
To use, include png_draw.h, compile with png_draw.c, and link with the -lpng
flag.

green.*: A set of functions for computing discrete green's functions and
heat kernels.  Can compute both of these for arbitrary graphs, and has
specialised functions to compute those of path and lattice graphs quickly,
using the formulas given in the paper "Discrete Green's Functions" by 
Fan Chung and S.T. Yau.

test.cpp:  A sanity check program for green.hpp.   

sandpile-draw.cpp:  Computes the final configuration for Z^2 sandpiles, 
which admit a fractal pattern, and draws them as png files.
